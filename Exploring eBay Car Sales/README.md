# Introduction to the project

A [classified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising) advertisement is a form of advertising, commonly found in newspapers, online or other periodicals, which is sold or distributed free of charge. 

**eBay Kleinanzeigen** is a classified section of **German** eBay website. 

The [dataset](https://data.world/data-society/used-cars-data) consists information of used cars from the website. 

The aim of the project is to analyze the included used car listings and answer few questions: <br>
**1. What is the average price of the top 6 brands in the used car listings?** <br>
**2. Is there a link between the top 6 brands' car price and the average mileage?**

# Outline of analysis
* We saw the **top 6 brands** with the **highest average price.**
* Then we found out the **mean mileage of the top 6 brands.**
* We can say that, even though the car has a **higher mileage, those top 6 brands are very expensive in the used cars.**
* I believe, this is mainly due to the **brand value** which they posses in the industry and the car market. And also people are very **brand conscious**, willing to buy these cars even when they are **driven more and expensive, too.**
