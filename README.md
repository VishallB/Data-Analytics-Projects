# Data-Analytics-Projects
Welcome to my repository for Data Analysis projects completed as part of the Dataquest-Data-Analyst-Path. This repository documents my learning journey, and I will continue to update it as I complete more projects.

# Part 1 - Introduction to Python
This section covers the basics of Python and introduces foundational concepts like variables, data types, lists, for loops, and conditional statements. It also covers advanced concepts such as dictionaries, frequency tables, functions, Jupyter Notebook, data cleaning, and object-oriented programming.

### Project 1: Helicopter Prison Break
In this beginner-level project, we analyzed data from the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes) article to find the year and countries with the most attempted helicopter prison breaks using control statements and lists.

### Project 2: Profitable Apps for Google Play Store and App Store
In this project, we used datasets from [Google Play Store](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and [App Store](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) to find popular free English apps for developing a new app to be uploaded to the Play Store and App Store, with the revenue being generated through in-app advertising.

### Project 3: Exploring Hacker News Posts
This project used a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) to analyze user engagement and activity in Hacker News posts. The main goal was to compare Ask HN and Show HN post engagement and determine if certain post creation times result in more engagement.

# Part 2 - Intermediate Python and Pandas
This section covers intermediate-level Python concepts, including Pandas and NumPy fundamentals, data visualization, and information design.

### Project 1: Exploring eBay Car Sales Data
In this project, we analyzed a dataset of used car listings from the German eBay website, examining the average price and mileage of the top six car brands. We used Pandas for data cleaning, exploration, and correction, and gained experience working with different dataframe and series methods.

### Project 2: Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94
In this project, we analyzed the data set of the I-94 highway and determined the indicators for the traffic. We used pandas extensively for data cleaning and creating new columns, exploring and for visualization, we used matplotlib and seaborn. Learnt about data visualization and creating charts based on the questions that need to be answered.
