### Project 1: Helicopter Prison Break

In this project, the data was taken from the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes) article which had the list of helicopter prison escapes. Since, it was a beginner project, only lists and control statements were used to manipulate the data and find the results.
