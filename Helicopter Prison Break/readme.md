# Helicopter Prison Break

## Introduction for the project

The goal of this project was to analyse helicopter prison breaks which occur throught the world in different prisons. The data was used from the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes) article. 

The main aim of this project was to find out two questions:
1. In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempt occur?
2. In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison breaks occur?

# Outline of analysis

* Since, this was the first project, we assesed the data by using only control flow statements and a few built-in functions.
* Performed some data mainpulation by formatting the date column of the data.
