# Project: Analyzing Hacker News Posts

## Introduction
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a popular site where users can submit and vote on stories, similar to Reddit. In this project, we'll be analyzing posts with titles that begin with **Ask HN** or **Show HN**. These posts are particularly interesting because they invite discussion and feedback from the community. 

The main objective of this project is to analyze the posts and determine:
1. Which type of post (Ask HN or Show HN) receives more comments on average
2. At what time are posts created that receive the most comments on average

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). It contains approximately 300,000 rows of data, with each row representing a single post on Hacker News.

## Technologies Used
The project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. We'll be using the datetime module to work with dates, and several string methods to work with string data.

## Conclusion
By analyzing the Hacker News posts, we were able to determine that on average, **Ask HN** posts receive more comments than **Show HN** posts. We also found that the time of day when posts are created can have a significant impact on the number of comments they receive. Posts created between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM EST receive the most comments on average. This information can be useful for individuals or companies looking to maximize engagement on their posts.
