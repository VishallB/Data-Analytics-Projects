# Introduction to the project

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a site, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to Reddit. The site is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, mainly because the posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result. 

The posts on Hacker News with titles **Ask HN** or **Show HN** means:
- **Ask HN** posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.
- **Show HN** posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or something interesting.

We are interested in the above titles, **Ask HN** or **Show HN**. By using these two types of posts, we will analyze
1. Do **Ask HN** or **Show HN** recevie more comments on average?
2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

# Outline of analysis

* Used several string methods to work with string data
* Used datetime module to work with dates

P.S: Couldn't upload the dataset because of the size. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts)
