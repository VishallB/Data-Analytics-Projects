# Profitable Apps for Google Play and App Store

## Introduction for the project

In this project, we aimed to analyze datasets from Google Play and App Store to develop a free app that would be profitable through in-app ads. Our goal was to identify the most popular free English apps in both Google Play and App Store, as the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. 

We used the [Google Play](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and [App Store](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) datasets for our analysis.

## Outline of analysis
Our analysis involved the following steps:
- Detecting and correcting incorrect data
- Removing duplicate data
- Isolating the free apps from the paid ones.
