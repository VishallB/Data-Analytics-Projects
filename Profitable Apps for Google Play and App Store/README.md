# Profitable Apps for Google Play and App Store

## Introduction for the project

- The goal of this project was to analyze datasets of [Google Play](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and [App Store](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) and develop a free app and make it available on Google Play and App Store.
- Since the app is free, the source of revenue would be from in-app adds. Therefore, using the above dataset, we had to analyze what kind of free English apps are the most popular on both Google Play and App Store -  the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better.

## Outline of analysis
- Detected incorrect data
- Deleted duplicate data 
- Isolated the free apps from the paid ones.
